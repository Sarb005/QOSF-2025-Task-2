This notebook does the first part of 2nd task which is to perform state preparation for 2-qubit state.
It has a good starting description on what are the single qubit and double-qubit states.
Then it will prompt the user to prompt in the input array for the task and will perform the normalisation and dimentionality check later
In the end, will print the final state
