# ðŸ§  Qubit State Preparation Notebook

This first notebook implements the **first part of the second task**: **preparing a two-qubit quantum state**.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

- Provides an **introduction** to **single-qubit** and **two-qubit states**, including the computational basis and vector representation.  
- Prompts the user to **input a four-element array of complex amplitudes** representing the two-qubit state.  
- Performs **normalization** and checks for **correct dimensionality**.  
- Finally, **prints the normalized two-qubit state** in **Dirac notation**.

The second notebook implements the **extension part to accomdate for three-qubit state preparation**

---
## ðŸ“– Overview

- Provides an **introduction** to **three-qubit**  including the computational basis and vector representation.  
- Prompts the user to **input an eight-element array of complex amplitudes** representing the three-qubit state.  
- Performs **normalization** and checks for **correct dimensionality**.  
- Finally, **prints the normalized three-qubit state** in **Dirac notation**.
